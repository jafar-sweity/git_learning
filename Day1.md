    - **Bare repositories --- git init --bare :** is a repository that does not have a working directory , a bare repository only consists of the version control data, including the repository's history, branches, tags, and configuration, but without the checked-out files.
    - The most common use case for  git init --bare is to create a remote central repository:

- **git clone** : 
    - is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.
